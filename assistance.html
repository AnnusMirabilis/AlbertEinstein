            "hey": "Hey! What would you like to know?",
            "how are you": "I am a program, but I'm functioning perfectly:). Thank you for asking!",
            "who are you":"I am an AI created by humans for education purpose. I'm here to help you learn more about Albert Einstein. I'm his assistance by the way!",
            
            // Specific topics by number and keyword
            "1": "While Albert Einstein was not a biologist, his work had a profound impact on the field. His 1905 paper on Brownian motion helped confirm the existence of atoms and molecules, which is a fundamental concept in biology.",
            "2": "Some of Albert Einstein's most influential publications came in his 'annus mirabilis' (miracle year) of 1905, including papers on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and the equivalence of mass and energy (E=mc²).",
            "3": "Einstein received numerous rewards and honors. The most famous was the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics, which he was awarded for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect. He was also honored with the Copley Medal and the Franklin Medal.",
            "4": "Some of Einstein's most significant predictions include gravitational lensing, where massive objects bend light; the existence of gravitational waves, ripples in spacetime; and the possibility of black holes, regions of space where gravity is so strong that nothing can escape.",
            "5": "Einstein's E=mc² formula showed the immense energy potential within matter, which was a theoretical basis for nuclear power. He signed a letter to President Roosevelt in 1939, urging the U.S. to research atomic weapons, which later led to the Manhattan Project. He later expressed regret over his role.",
            "6": "Owner:\n1. Minh le\n2. Trever Janosek\n3. Gaige Merrit\n4. John Vu\n5. Aman Pohjonen",
            "nuclear power": "Einstein's E=mc² formula showed the immense energy potential within matter, which was a theoretical basis for nuclear power. He signed a letter to President Roosevelt in 1939, urging the U.S. to research atomic weapons, which later led to the Manhattan Project. He later expressed regret over his role.",


            // Keyword-based topics
            "theory":"Some of Albert Einstein's theory are: Special Relativity (1905) established that space and time are relative, not absolute, giving rise to time dilation and E=mc2. General Relativity (1915) redefined gravity as a curvature of space-time caused by mass.",
            "life":"Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist. He developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics. In 1921, he won the Nobel Prize for his discovery of the photoelectric effect, which helped establish quantum theory. Fleeing the Nazis, he emigrated to the U.S. in 1933 and became a vocal advocate for civil rights and peace.",
            "famous for": "Albert Einstein is most famous for developing the theory of relativity, which includes the well-known equation E=mc². He also made significant contributions to the development of quantum mechanics.",
            "born": "Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany.",
            "died": "Albert Einstein passed away on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey, at the age of 76.",
            "noble prize": "He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his 'services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.'",
            "education": "He attended the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich, where he trained as a teacher of physics and mathematics.",
            "where he lived": "After leaving Germany, he became a Swiss citizen and eventually settled in the United States, where he worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.",
            "thery of relativity": "The theory of relativity, developed by Einstein, is a scientific theory regarding the relationship between space and time.",
            "e=mc2": "This famous equation, E=mc², means that energy (E) and mass (m) are equivalent and interconvertible. The 'c' represents the speed of light.",
            "quote": "A famous quote by Einstein is: 'The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence.'",
            "brain": "After his death, Einstein's brain was preserved and studied by scientists, though the findings have been a subject of much debate and controversy.",
            "nuclear": "Einstein has no actual theory about nuclear but in 1939, Einstein signed a letter to President Roosevelt, warning of Germany's potential to build an atomic bomb. This letter was crucial in starting the Manhattan Project. He later regretted this and advocated for nuclear disarmament.",
            "photoelectric":"In 1905, Albert Einstein explained the photoelectric effect, a mystery where light hitting a metal surface ejects electrons. He proposed that light exists as discrete energy packets called photons.",
            "brownian motion":"Brownian motion is the random, erratic movement of microscopic particles suspended in a fluid. In 1905, Albert Einstein explained that this visible motion was caused by the particles being bombarded by invisible atoms and molecules. His work provided definitive proof for the existence of atoms.",
